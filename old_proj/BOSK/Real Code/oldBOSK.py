# Map section

"""
map = [
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
]
"""

# ppx = 
# x value of the player's position
# ppy = 
# y value of the player's position
# map[ppx][ppy]
#
# e.g.
# if player goes north
#   ppx = ppx
#   ppy -= 1
#
# We wil need to always keep track of both of these variables ppy and ppx.
# This will allow us to implement the "go" command, like so:
# -> I'm a noob so this is not the correct syntax obviously. <-
# def go_north:
#   ppy -= 1
# def go_south:
#   ppy += 1
#
# Or maybe even like a command that takes an argument:
# go <direction> (north, east, south, west)
#
# Then, once we have the player's position, we can define what happens in said
# position of the map.
# Maybe we could define every little piece of the map individually,
# like in FPSes or other games.
# So we would have to define map[0][0], map[0][1]...
# (Maybe there's a better way.)
# With this method we can also "remember" what the player did in each single
# instance of the map. This is useful as the player may come back to a part of
# the map, to speak to an NPC again or find a new solution for that part.
